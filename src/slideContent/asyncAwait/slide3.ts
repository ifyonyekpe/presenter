export const slide3 = `## Benefits
* Responsiveness and Scalability
    > **hide latency** of potentially long-running or blocking operations (e.g. I/O) by starting in the background.
    So if you have any I/O bound needs (such as requesting from a \`network\` or \`accessing a database\`)
* Performance
    > **reduce execution** time of CPU-bound computations by dividing workload into chunks and executing simultaneously
